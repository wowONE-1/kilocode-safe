# Agent Manager

The Agent Manager is a control panel for running and orchestrating multiple Kilo Code agents, with support for parallel worktree-isolated sessions.

The Agent Manager is a **full-panel editor tab** built directly into the extension. It uses the extension's embedded runtime, so no separate Kilo CLI installation or CLI authentication setup is required. It supports:

- Multiple parallel sessions, each in its own git worktree
- A diff/review panel showing changes vs. the parent branch
- Dedicated VS Code integrated terminals per session
- Setup scripts and `.env` auto-copy on worktree creation
- Session import from existing branches, external worktrees, or GitHub PR URLs
- "Continue in Worktree" to promote a sidebar session to the Agent Manager
- The same providers, BYOK keys, custom providers, and extension features supported in the sidebar

{% callout type="tip" %}
New to running multiple agents in parallel? The [Agent Manager Workflows](/docs/automate/agent-manager-workflows) guide walks through when to use the sidebar vs. the Agent Manager, how to pick tasks that parallelize well, and the common patterns for testing, reviewing, and integrating changes across worktrees.
{% /callout %}

## Opening the Agent Manager

- Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+M` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Windows/Linux)
- Command Palette: "Kilo Code: Open Agent Manager"
- Click the Agent Manager icon in the sidebar toolbar

The panel opens as an editor tab and stays active across focus changes.

## Requirements

- Open a VS Code workspace folder
- Use a git repository for worktree features
- Open the main repository, not an existing worktree checkout, when creating new worktrees

## Project-scoped settings

Agent Manager worktree defaults belong to a repository. Open a project's settings button, then select the **Agent Manager** tab in Kilo Settings. The repository selector controls which project's default base branch and setup script you edit.

- **Automatic selection:** Opening settings from a project selects that repository. When you open the settings tab directly, Agent Manager restores the last selected repository if it is still listed, or uses the current workspace repository.
- **Explicit selection:** Choose another repository from the **Project** selector before changing its settings. The **Default Base Branch** control uses **Auto-detect** by default, or you can choose a specific branch. The selected value is saved for that repository and is used when creating new worktrees.
- **Stale branches:** If a saved default branch no longer exists, Agent Manager clears it when it refreshes the repository's branch list and returns to **Auto-detect**. Choose a new branch to set an explicit default again.

The **Worktree Setup Script** control opens or creates the setup script for the selected repository. See [Setup Scripts](#setup-scripts) for supported filenames and execution behavior.

## Providers and Authentication

Agent Manager uses the same sign-in, provider settings, models, BYOK keys, custom providers, MCP servers, and permission rules as the extension sidebar. Configure them from extension Settings and they apply to Agent Manager as well.

See [Authentication](/docs/getting-started/setup-authentication), [AI Providers](/docs/ai-providers), and [Bring Your Own Key](/docs/getting-started/byok) for setup details.

## Working with Worktrees

Each Agent Manager session runs in an isolated git worktree on a separate branch, keeping your main branch clean.

### Worktree Location

Managed worktrees are created under `.kilo/worktrees/` in your project. Kilo also stores Agent Manager UI state in `.kilo/agent-manager.json`.

{% callout type="info" %}
Worktrees share Git object storage with the main repository, but each worktree is still a separate checkout on disk. Files created inside each worktree, such as `node_modules`, build output, local databases, generated files, and package-manager caches, can multiply disk usage across parallel agents. Closing a managed worktree removes its checkout directory, but it does not remove external caches, containers, volumes, simulators, or databases that your scripts created outside the worktree.
{% /callout %}

### PR Status Badges

Each worktree item displays a **PR status badge** when its branch has an associated pull request. The badge shows the PR number (e.g. `#142`) and is color-coded to reflect the current state at a glance. Click the badge to open the PR in your browser.

{% callout type="info" %}
The GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated for PR badges to work. If `gh` is missing or not logged in, badges won't appear.
{% /callout %}

#### How PRs are detected

The extension uses `gh` to automatically discover PRs for each worktree branch. Three strategies are tried in order:

1. **Branch tracking ref** — `gh pr view` resolves via the branch's tracking ref (works for fork PRs checked out with `gh pr checkout`)
2. **Branch name** — `gh pr view <branch>` matches same-repo branches pushed to origin
3. **HEAD commit SHA** — `gh pr list --search "<sha>"` as a last resort, matching PRs whose head ref points to the exact same commit

You can also import a PR directly from the new worktree dialog: click **New Worktree** or press `Cmd+N` (macOS) / `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux), switch to the **Import** tab, then paste the GitHub PR URL. The branch is checked out and the badge appears automatically.

#### Badge colors

The badge color reflects the most important signal, evaluated in priority order:

| State | Color | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Draft | Gray | PR is in draft state |
| Merged | Purple | PR has been merged |
| Closed | Red | PR was closed without merging |
| Checks failing | Red | Any CI check has failed |
| Changes requested | Yellow | A reviewer requested changes |
| Checks pending | Yellow (pulsing) | CI checks are still running |
| Open (default) | Green | PR is open, no failing or pending checks, no blocking review |

When checks are pending on an open PR, the badge pulses to indicate activity.

#### Badge icon

The badge shows a **checkmark** icon when the PR review status is "Approved", and a **branch** icon in all other cases.

#### Hover card details

Hovering over a worktree item shows a card with additional PR details:

- **PR number** with a link icon to open it in the browser
- **State** — Open, Draft, Merged, or Closed
- **Review** — Approved, Changes Requested, or Pending (when a review exists)
- **Checks** — how many checks passed out of the total (e.g. `8/10 passed`)

#### Automatic updates

PR badges update automatically in the background. The active worktree refreshes frequently, while other worktrees sync periodically to keep badges current. Polling pauses when the Agent Manager panel is hidden.

### Reviewing a pull request

The PR review panel is available when the selected worktree has an associated pull request. Open it in either of these ways:

- Click the pull request icon in the Agent Manager toolbar
- Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux)

The selected worktree controls the panel. The panel shows the worktree branch and its parent branch, so confirm that you are reviewing the intended branch. The PR association uses the detection methods described above, including the branch tracking ref, branch name, or current commit SHA.

The panel includes:

- **Status:** Open, Draft, Merged, or Closed
- **Review status:** Approved, Changes Requested, or Review Pending
- **Checks:** passed, failed, running, cancelled, or skipped checks, with duration and browser links when available
- **Reviewers:** requested reviewers and their current state, such as Approved, Changes requested, Commented, or Awaiting
- **Description and summary:** the PR description, file count, additions, deletions, and unresolved comment count

#### Review comments

Expand a comment to read its Markdown body, replies, file and line location, and a bounded diff hunk around the commented line. Outdated threads show an **Outdated** label. Unresolved threads appear first. Resolved threads move into the **Resolved** group and are collapsed by default. Click a thread row to expand or collapse it.

Use the actions on an expanded thread to:

- **Send** the comment, its diff context, and replies to the current agent. **Send all unresolved** sends the unresolved threads together, up to the panel limit.
- **Resolve** or **Unresolve** the GitHub conversation. The panel refreshes the thread state after the action completes.
- **Copy** the formatted thread context
- **Open file** at the comment location in the selected worktree
- **Open on GitHub** at the comment

The panel header also provides **Copy PR link**, **Open in browser**, and **Close**. Sending a comment gives it to Kilo as review context. It does not post a reply to GitHub. The panel intentionally has no reply composer; write replies in GitHub.

### Creating a New Worktree Session

1. Click **New Worktree** or press `Cmd+N` (macOS) / `Ctrl+N` (Windows/Linux) to open the new worktree dialog
2. Enter a branch name (or let Kilo generate one)
3. Type your first message, then create the worktree

Kilo creates the worktree from the selected project's configured default base branch. In a multi-project workspace, the selected project determines this setting. An explicit base branch selected in the dialog takes precedence. If no default is configured, Kilo falls back to automatic detection of the repository's remote default branch. The agent works in isolation, so your main branch is unaffected.

To create a worktree immediately from the default base branch, press `Cmd+Shift+N` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows/Linux). This uses the selected project's configured default, or the automatic remote-default fallback when no configured default exists.

### Slash Commands in the Worktree Prompt

The new worktree prompt supports slash commands for its configuration options, so you can change them from the keyboard:

| Command | Aliases | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `/models` | `/model` | Open the model selector |
| `/agents` | `/modes` | Open the agent selector |
| `/variant` | `/variants`, `/reasoning`, `/thinking` | Open the reasoning effort selector |
| `/sandbox` | — | Toggle the sandbox for the new worktree |

Navigate the menu with the arrow keys, select with `Enter` or `Tab`, and close it with `Escape`. Focus returns to the prompt after a selection or cancellation. `/agents` appears only when multiple agents are available, `/variant` only when the selected model has reasoning variants, and `/sandbox` only when sandbox controls are enabled.

### Multi-Version Mode

You can run up to 4 parallel implementations of the same prompt across separate worktrees:

1. Click the multi-version button and enter a prompt
2. Optionally assign different models to each version
3. Kilo creates one worktree + session per version and runs them in parallel

### Importing Existing Work

- **From a branch:** Import an existing git branch as a worktree
- **From a GitHub PR URL:** Paste a PR URL to import it as a worktree
- **From an external worktree:** Import a worktree that already exists on disk
- **Continue in Worktree:** From the sidebar chat, promote the current session to a new Agent Manager worktree

Imported work stays associated with its branch or worktree and can be continued from Agent Manager.

### Sessions and History

- Create a worktree session to start a new agent in an isolated branch
- Press `Cmd+T` (macOS) / `Ctrl+T` (Windows/Linux) to start another session in the selected worktree
- Use session history to reopen local sessions or preview cloud sessions
- When a worktree is selected, open session history to use the **Worktree** source, which is selected by default and lists only sessions assigned to that worktree. Opening a worktree session returns to its owning worktree.
- Continue a cloud session locally from Agent Manager using the same extension sign-in and provider settings

File mentions, clickable file links, review-comment file links, file-link validation, and native VS Code opening resolve against the referenced session's directory or worktree. If a session ID is present in multiple projects, Kilo rejects the unqualified reference rather than choosing an arbitrary project.

When a session delegates work to a subagent, open the child transcript from its task card or background-agent row. Agent Manager displays it in the read-only **Subagents** inspector. The inspector supports multiple child-session tabs and keeps them scoped to the selected project and parent session. For the difference between Agent Manager inspector tabs and the separate subagent editor tabs used by the sidebar, see [Inspecting delegated sessions in VS Code](/docs/customize/custom-subagents#inspecting-delegated-sessions-in-vs-code).

### Renaming Worktrees

Double-click a worktree name to edit its label inline. You can also right-click the worktree and choose **Rename**. Press `Enter` or click outside the field to save, or press `Escape` to cancel.

Renaming a worktree changes only the label shown in Agent Manager. It does not rename the underlying git branch.

## Starting Sessions From Chat

Kilo can start Agent Manager sessions from chat with the `agent_manager` tool. It is available by default only in the VS Code extension because Agent Manager is an extension feature.

The tool supports two modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `worktree` | Creates one Agent Manager git worktree and session per task |
| `local` | Creates Agent Manager sessions in the current workspace without git worktree isolation |

Each request can include 1-20 tasks. Each task must include at least one of `prompt`, `name`, or `branchName`. Prompted tasks inherit the model and reasoning variant used by the chat turn that starts them. A task can override that selection with a `model` (by name, e.g. `Claude Opus 4.1`) when you explicitly request a different model, or with one of the current model's reasoning `variant` values when you request a different variant. Add `provider` beside `model` to force a model-name match to one of the listed provider IDs. Agent Manager resolves the provider for a model override when `provider` is omitted, preferring the provider used by the current turn and falling back to the Kilo Gateway; a qualified `provider/model` ID is also accepted. Prepared sessions without an initial prompt use the normal model defaults. Use `versions: true` only when the tasks are alternate versions of the same work to compare; otherwise, multiple tasks start as independent sessions.

The companion `agent_manager_models` tool searches models and their supported reasoning variants on demand. Results are grouped by model name (with the offering providers listed for reference) and limited to 20 per call, so the full catalog is never added to the conversation context.

The same tool also manages existing sessions. It can return an overview of sections, worktrees, and local sessions, send a prompt to one managed session, stop a managed session, or move a session's worktree into a section. The overview includes section IDs, each section's assigned worktrees, worktree IDs, and session IDs. Use those exact IDs for a subsequent move. Moving accepts a section ID from the overview, or `null` to ungroup the worktree. Moving a session moves its whole worktree, including multi-version siblings. Local sessions cannot be assigned to a section. Stopping aborts the session's active work and removes it from the panel, just like closing the session tab.

Prompts to busy or retrying sessions enter the same queue as follow-up messages sent from chat. The tool returns when the prompt is accepted, without waiting for it to run or finish. Sessions with pending questions or permission requests still refuse prompts. Answer the question with `action: "answer"`, or resolve the permission request in Agent Manager, before prompting again.

The tool uses the `agent_manager` permission. Approval prompts are scoped to the requested capability, so approving `worktree` does not automatically approve `local`, an overview, or a targeted prompt. Prompting an existing managed session requires an explicit `prompt` approval the first time, even if Agent Manager session creation was previously approved broadly. Stopping a session likewise requires an explicit `stop` approval, and moving a worktree requires an explicit `move` approval.

## Sections

Sections let you group worktrees into collapsible, color-coded folders in the sidebar. Use them to organize your workflow however you like — by status ("Review Pending", "In Progress"), by project area ("Frontend", "Backend"), priority, or any other scheme that fits.

### Creating a Section

- **Right-click** any worktree and select **New Section** from the context menu
- A new section is created with a random color and enters rename mode immediately — type a name and press `Enter`

### Assigning Worktrees to Sections

**Via context menu:** Right-click a worktree, hover **Move to Section**, and pick a section from the list. Select **Ungrouped** to remove it from its current section.

**Via drag and drop:** Drag a worktree and drop it onto a section header to move it there.

Multi-version worktrees (created via Multi-Version Mode) are moved together — assigning one version to a section moves all versions in the group.

### Renaming Sections

Right-click the section header and select **Rename Section**. An inline text field appears — type the new name and press `Enter` to confirm or `Escape` to cancel.

### Colors

Right-click the section header and select **Set Color** to open the color picker. Eight colors are available (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Magenta) plus a **Default** option that uses the standard panel border color. The selected color appears as a left border stripe on the section.

### Reordering

Right-click the section header and use **Move Up** / **Move Down** to reposition it in the sidebar. Sections and ungrouped worktrees share the same ordering space.

### Collapsing

Click the section header to toggle it open or closed. Collapsed sections hide their worktrees and show only the section name and a member count badge. Collapse state is persisted across reloads.

### Deleting a Section

Right-click the section header and select **Delete Section**. The section is removed but its worktrees are preserved — they become ungrouped.

## Sending Messages, Approvals, and Control

- **Continue the conversation:** Send a follow-up message to the running agent
- **Approvals:** The Permission Dock shows tool approval prompts — approve once, approve always, or deny
- **Cancel:** Sends a cooperative stop signal to the agent
- **Stop:** Force-terminates the session and marks it as stopped

## Previewing pending edits

When an agent requests permission to run `edit`, `write`, or `apply_patch`, the permission card shows the proposed file changes. In Agent Manager, select the expand button on the file diff to open an **Edit preview** in the side panel.

The preview supports patches that contain multiple files and shows each file's diff. Use the view selector to switch between **unified** and **split** views. You can close the preview without changing the request or its patch.

Previewing only displays the proposed changes. It does not approve or deny the pending tool request, apply changes to your local checkout, or revert a file. Make those decisions and use those actions from their respective controls. Outside Agent Manager, the same file-diff control opens the preview in a separate diff tab instead of the side panel.

## Diff / Review Panel

Press `Cmd+D` (macOS) / `Ctrl+D` (Windows/Linux) to toggle the diff panel. It shows a live-updating diff between the worktree and its parent branch.

The worktree creation base and the diff comparison base are separate. The Branch scope starts with the worktree's recorded parent branch, and its base-branch picker changes only the comparison target. It does not change the branch from which the worktree was created.

- Select files and click **Apply to local** to copy the worktree's changes onto your local checkout of the base branch
- Conflicts are surfaced with a resolution dialog
- Supports unified and split diff views
- Markdown files include an eye/code toggle in the file header to switch between rendered Markdown and the raw diff
- **Drag file headers into chat** — drag a file header from the diff panel into the chat input to insert an `@file` mention, giving the agent context about specific changed files

### Sending review comments

Add comments in the diff panel or in the rendered view of a Markdown document. Click **Send all to chat** to send the collected comments to chat. If an Agent Manager terminal is active, the comments are sent to that terminal instead. Press `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) to use the same action from the review panel.

After sending, the local comment collection is cleared. To discard collected comments without sending them, click **Clear all** in the chat input.

### Diff Scope

A scope selector in the diff toolbar (both in the side panel and the full-screen review) chooses which changes the diff shows:

- **Branch** (default) — the full worktree diff against its parent branch, matching the review behavior above
- **Staged** — staged changes in the selected worktree
- **Unstaged** — unstaged changes in the selected worktree
- **Session** — changes from the selected session

The Branch scope also has a base-branch picker next to it for overriding the comparison branch. **Apply to local** works only on the Branch scope — switch back to Branch to apply.

See [Agent Manager Workflows](/docs/automate/agent-manager-workflows#merging-worktree-and-parent-branch) for the full integration story, including when to apply locally vs. merge directly vs. open a pull request.

## Documents inspector

The Documents inspector previews Markdown file references from Agent Manager chat without leaving the panel. Open a file reference to add it as a document tab, then use the tab strip to switch, reorder, or close open documents. The inspector keeps one tab per file in the active project and worktree context.

- Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`, and `.markdown`) open in rendered view by default. Use the preview/source toggle to switch between rendered Markdown and syntax-highlighted source.
- The document renderer also supports syntax-highlighted text and inline PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, and SVG previews when a document payload is available. Normal Agent Manager file-opening actions route non-Markdown source references to the native VS Code editor.
- Use **Open file** to open the document in the native VS Code editor. The original line and column are preserved when available.
- Unsupported, binary, missing, out-of-scope, or oversized files show an error fallback in the inspector. Text previews are limited to 2 MB and image previews to 5 MB; open the file in VS Code to inspect larger or unsupported content.

### Inline document review

In a rendered Markdown preview, use the comment control in the line gutter to add a comment at that line. Clicking a line number opens that location in the native editor. Draft comments can be edited or deleted, sent individually to the active session, or sent together with **Send all to chat**. Comments are attached to the document path and line, and remain isolated to the active project and worktree context.

The project and worktree context owns document tabs, loaded content, and comments. The session ID attached to an opened file selects the session's worktree for reading and native-editor navigation. Sessions that share one worktree also share its document inspector state; switching project or worktree changes the visible context without mixing tabs or comments across worktrees.

## Terminals

Each session has a dedicated terminal rooted in the session's worktree directory. Press `Cmd+/` (macOS) / `Ctrl+/` (Windows/Linux) to focus the terminal for the active session. If the embedded terminal is already visible but the prompt has focus, the same shortcut focuses the terminal without hiding it. Press it again while the terminal has focus to hide the panel.

When you use `@terminal` in an Agent Manager prompt, Kilo captures the focused terminal for the selected session or worktree. This includes embedded **Run** and **Setup** tabs. Terminal context is limited to 500 lines or 50,000 characters; longer output is truncated.

### Choosing the Terminal Destination

The toolbar's terminal button is a split button: click it to open a terminal, or use its dropdown to choose where terminals open:

- **VS Code terminal** (default) — opens or focuses the VS Code integrated terminal at the bottom of the window
- **Agent Manager panel** — opens an embedded terminal in the side panel that also hosts the diff view, so the shell stays inside the Agent Manager layout

The dropdown choice is remembered per panel and becomes the default for new panels. You can also set the default directly with the `kilo-code.new.agentManager.terminalButtonDestination` setting (`vscode` or `agentManager`). The `Cmd+/` (macOS) / `Ctrl+/` (Windows/Linux) shortcut follows the same destination.

With the **Agent Manager panel** destination, the terminal works like the diff panel: press `Cmd+/` to reveal and focus it, press it while the panel is visible but another control has focus to move focus into the terminal, and press it again from the terminal to hide it. Hiding never stops the terminal — scrollback and running processes continue in the background, and focus returns to the chat input. A terminal stops only when you click its close button or type `exit` in the shell.

### Multiple Terminals

Agent Manager has two separate terminal tab strips:

- **Main terminal tabs** appear alongside the agent session tabs. With the prompt or a main terminal focused, press `Cmd+Shift+T` / `Ctrl+Shift+T` to create another main terminal tab.
- **Side terminal tabs** appear in the terminal panel. Focus a side terminal, then press `Cmd+Shift+T` / `Ctrl+Shift+T` to create another side terminal. You can also click **+** in the side-terminal strip.

The shortcut follows terminal focus, not panel visibility. A visible side panel with the prompt focused still creates a main terminal tab. Press `Cmd+Shift+[` / `Ctrl+Shift+[` for the previous terminal or `Cmd+Shift+]` / `Ctrl+Shift+]` for the next terminal in the focused terminal strip. Drag tabs to reorder them. Pressing `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` with a focused side terminal closes that terminal when other terminals remain. On the last side terminal, it hides the panel and keeps the shell alive; use its close button or type `exit` to stop it.

`Cmd+T` / `Ctrl+T` always creates a new agent session tab. It never creates a terminal.

New terminals are named "Terminal N" using the lowest free number, and tabs pick up the live title from the shell or running program, so a dev server or editor names its own tab.

### Switching Between Terminal and Agent Manager

A common workflow is letting the agent work, then switching to the terminal to run tests or inspect the worktree, then switching back to control the agent:

1. **Agent Manager → Terminal:** Press `Cmd+/` (macOS) / `Ctrl+/` (Windows/Linux) to open and focus the terminal for the current session. The terminal runs inside the session's worktree, so commands like `npm test` or `git status` operate on the agent's isolated branch.
2. **Terminal → Agent Manager:** Press `Cmd+Shift+M` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Windows/Linux) to bring focus back to the Agent Manager panel and its prompt input. This explicit shortcut always targets the prompt and works from anywhere in VS Code — the terminal, another editor tab, or the sidebar. Returning to the panel by clicking its editor tab or switching windows restores the last focused control instead.

## Setup Scripts

Setup scripts let you prepare each new worktree before the agent starts, for example by installing dependencies, linking local config, copying non-standard env files, or creating per-worktree databases.

Create a script file in `.kilo/` using the appropriate filename for your platform:

| Platform | Filename (checked in order) |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `.kilo/setup-script`, `.kilo/setup-script.sh` |
| Windows | `.kilo/setup-script.ps1`, `.kilo/setup-script.cmd`, `.kilo/setup-script.bat` |

Kilo runs the script automatically whenever a new worktree is created. It uses `sh` for POSIX scripts, PowerShell for `.ps1`, and `cmd.exe` for `.cmd` / `.bat`, so executable permissions are not required.

Where the script runs follows the terminal destination dropdown in the Agent Manager toolbar. **Agent Manager panel** shows live output in a named `Setup` tab in the side terminal panel. After success, the panel returns to its previous state unless you interacted with it; the retained tab remains available for review. Failures keep the panel open. **VS Code terminal** runs setup as a task in the integrated terminal. The script keeps the existing five-minute timeout; when it expires, the setup process tree is terminated and the failed tab retains its partial output.

Two extra variables are injected into the setup script's environment:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `WORKTREE_PATH` | Absolute path to the new worktree directory |
| `REPO_PATH` | Repository root |

For example, on macOS / Linux:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e

cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
npm install

# Copy a nested env file that Kilo does not auto-copy.
if [ -f "$REPO_PATH/apps/web/.env.local" ] && [ ! -f "$WORKTREE_PATH/apps/web/.env.local" ]; then
  cp "$REPO_PATH/apps/web/.env.local" "$WORKTREE_PATH/apps/web/.env.local"
fi
```

If the setup script fails, Agent Manager shows the failure (a failed `Setup` tab in the side terminal panel, or the task output in the integrated terminal) and keeps the worktree available so you can inspect it, fix the script, or run setup steps manually.

### Environment File Copying

Before the setup script runs, Kilo automatically copies root-level `.env` files from the main repo into the new worktree.

Copied automatically:

- Root-level plain files named exactly `.env`
- Root-level plain files matching `.env.*`, such as `.env.local` or `.env.development`

Not copied automatically:

- Nested env files, such as `apps/web/.env.local`
- Non-dotenv files, such as `.envrc`, `.environment`, or `.env-cmdrc`
- Directories named `.env` or `.env.local`
- Files that already exist in the worktree, because Kilo never overwrites them

Use `.kilo/setup-script` for anything outside the automatic copy rules, including nested env files, ignored local config, local certificates, local database files, generated config directories, or tool-specific files required to run the project.

## Run Script

The run button lets you start your project (dev server, build, tests, etc.) directly from the Agent Manager toolbar without switching to a terminal. It executes a shell script you define once, and runs it in the context of whichever worktree is currently selected.

### Setting up a run script

Create a script file in `.kilo/` using the appropriate filename for your platform:

| Platform | Filename (checked in order) |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `.kilo/run-script`, `.kilo/run-script.sh` |
| Windows | `.kilo/run-script.ps1`, `.kilo/run-script.cmd`, `.kilo/run-script.bat` |

For example, on macOS / Linux create `.kilo/run-script`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
npm run dev
```

For projects that need a unique dev-server port per worktree, assign the port in the run script and make your app read it from `PORT`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e

# Pick a deterministic port from the worktree path so each worktree keeps the same URL.
sum=$(cksum <<EOF | cut -d ' ' -f 1
$WORKTREE_PATH
EOF
)
export PORT=$((4000 + (sum % 1000)))

echo "Starting dev server on http://localhost:$PORT"
npm run dev
```

If your stack supports `PORT=0`, you can also let the OS pick a free port instead. Prefer app-side env support where possible, then use the run script to provide per-worktree defaults.

The next time you click the run button (or press `Cmd+E` / `Ctrl+E`), the script runs in the selected worktree's directory.

{% callout type="tip" %}
If no run script exists yet, clicking the run button opens a template file for you to fill in.
{% /callout %}

### Environment variables

Two extra variables are injected into the script's environment:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `WORKTREE_PATH` | Working directory of the selected worktree (or repo root for "local") |
| `REPO_PATH` | Repository root |

### Using the run button

- **Run:** Click the play button in the toolbar or press `Cmd+E` (macOS) / `Ctrl+E` (Windows/Linux). Output appears in a named `Run` tab in the Agent Manager terminal panel and remains available after the script exits.
- **Stop:** Click the stop button (same position) or press `Cmd+E` again while running.
- **Configure:** Click the dropdown arrow next to the run button and select "Configure run script" to open the script in your editor.

The terminal destination dropdown in the Agent Manager toolbar also controls where the script runs. **Agent Manager panel** uses the named side terminal, while **VS Code terminal** runs it as a task in the integrated terminal. The integrated terminal option is kept for comparison and will be removed in a future release.

## Session State and Persistence

Agent Manager state is persisted in `.kilo/agent-manager.json`. It stores worktrees, sections, session tabs, ordering, collapsed state, diff preferences, and cached PR metadata. Git branches and worktree directories remain on disk separately.

Closing a managed worktree removes it from Agent Manager, deletes its `.kilo/worktrees/` directory, and deletes the local branch. Closing an imported external worktree removes the Agent Manager entry but leaves the external directory and branch untouched.

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Agent Manager Panel)

| Shortcut (macOS) | Shortcut (Windows/Linux) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `Cmd+Shift+M` | `Ctrl+Shift+M` | Open / focus Agent Manager (works from anywhere) |

## Troubleshooting

- **"Please open a folder…" error** — the Agent Manager requires a VS Code workspace folder
- **Worktree creation fails** — ensure Git is installed and the workspace is a valid git repository. Open the main repository (where `.git` is a directory), not an existing worktree checkout.
- **A configured base branch is missing** — Kilo clears the stale project setting and uses automatic remote-default detection for the new worktree. Select the project and configure a new default if needed.
- **Provider or authentication errors** — open extension Settings and verify your sign-in, provider, model, or BYOK configuration. Agent Manager uses the same settings as the sidebar.
- **Session history missing cloud sessions** — sign in through the extension and confirm the repository remote matches the sessions you expect to see.
- **PR badges, the review panel, or PR import missing:** install the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and authenticate it for the repository. Run `gh auth status` to check the current login. GitHub PR features do not work until `gh` is available and authenticated.
- **PR data looks temporarily stale:** polling pauses while the Agent Manager panel is hidden, and background updates are not instantaneous. Close and reopen the PR panel, or switch worktrees and select the original worktree again, to trigger a fresh lookup. A transient GitHub, network, or fork lookup failure can leave the last known PR data visible until the next successful refresh.
